Ok, so i plotted the daily values for a couple of typical days, and noticed some periodic trend which looks like
each dayly cycle could be approximated with a 5th or 6th degree polynomial, though i'm going to come back to this. 
I then plotted the daily average for a couple of typical months, and noticed no trend, so i checked the qq-norm
plots for the daily averages for all years for any given month, and they appear to be normally distributed.
I then plotted the dayly average across the entire dataset, and noticed a periodic function.
I then plotted the monthly average, and overlayed them for each year. There does not look to be a trend between 
the averages relative to the years.
Ok, with all this in mind, to compare this historical data to later years i'm going to 
1) determine the parameters for the normal distribution of daily values for each month
2) determine the function that best fits the daily power demands for any given day.
3) determine the function that best fits the mean of the monthly average over the corse of a year
